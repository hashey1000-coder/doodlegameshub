Paddle your canoe through a series of hanging gates on a churning river, timing each stroke to thread the needle without touching the poles. Missing a gate or hitting the wrong side adds precious seconds to your time. Precision is everything.\n\nCanoe slalom has been an Olympic sport since the 1972 Munich Games and requires athletes to navigate a 250-metre whitewater course through 18 to 25 gates in the fastest time possible. This Doodle captures the sport's unique challenge of reading water currents and planning your line several gates ahead. The two-second time penalty for touching a gate pole mirrors the real Olympic rules, making each brush with a gate genuinely costly.`,
